Output: [MATH] Math Solution:
 To solve this problem, we follow the order of operations, which is commonly remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Step 1: Multiply the numbers being multiplied, which are 25 and 3. That gives us 75.

Step 2: Add the number that was not involved in the multiplication, which is 15.

So, 15 + (25 * 3) = 15 + 75 = 90

The final answer is 90.
